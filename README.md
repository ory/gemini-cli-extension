# Ory Agent Extension: Gemini CLI

[Ory](https://ory.com) bundled into [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli): skills and TOML slash commands that scaffold Ory authentication into your codebase, a local Ory stack you can spin up in one command, and (when pointed at an Ory project) authentication, authorization, and audit for every tool Gemini runs.

You don't need an Ory account or any prior Ory experience to start.

## New to Ory?

[Ory](https://www.ory.com/docs/) is an open-source identity and access platform — it provides login, registration, sessions, social sign-in, multi-factor auth, and fine-grained permissions, so you don't have to build any of that yourself. Two things make it easy to try with no prior experience:

- **Ory Elements** are prebuilt, themeable UI components for the auth pages (login, registration, recovery, settings). The scaffolding skills wire them into your app for you.
- **The local Ory stack** is a complete Ory running on your laptop in Docker — no account, no signup, no API key. Everything in the Quickstart below works against it, fully offline.

This extension does two independent things, and you can use either on its own:

1. **Build auth into your app.** Have Gemini scaffold Ory login, registration, social sign-in, and permissions into the project you're working on, backed by the local stack. This is the Quickstart below — it needs nothing but Docker.
2. **Govern the agent itself.** Authenticate Gemini's own session and authorize every tool it runs against Ory Permissions, with a full audit trail. See [Agent security](#agent-security).

If you're just exploring, do the Quickstart first.

## Prerequisites

- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed and signed in
- Node.js **≥ 22**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (only needed for the local Ory stack)
- macOS or Linux. Windows works via WSL2.

## Install

In your shell:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/ory/gemini-cli-extension
```

Then confirm everything landed:

```bash
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini status
```

`status` is the single source of truth — it prints configuration, user and agent identity, per-tool permission coverage, extension + skill registration, and a tail of recent debug logs. Unconfigured fields show inline as `(unset)`.

<details>
<summary>Alternative install paths</summary>

```bash
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini install
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini uninstall
```

If the `gemini` binary isn't on your `PATH`, `npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini-setup` writes the extension config directly into your project's `.gemini/settings.json`.

</details>

## Quickstart (≈ 3 minutes)

From any project where you'd like Ory authentication, inside Gemini CLI:

1. **Start a local Ory instance.** Ask Gemini *"start the local Ory stack"* or run:

   ```
   /ory:local-up
   ```

   A banner prints the seeded test user's email and password. Note them — you'll log in with them in step 3.

2. **Scaffold Ory into your project.** Ask Gemini *"add Ory auth to this app"* or invoke the `ory-auth-setup` skill.

   Gemini installs Ory Elements, wires the SDK, generates the login / registration / recovery / verification / settings pages, and sets up session middleware. It targets the local stack from step 1, so no signup or API key is needed.

3. **Sign in.** Start your app, visit the login page Gemini added, and sign in with the seeded credentials. You now have a real Ory session backed by a real Ory stack — locally, offline, with zero configuration.

4. **Turn on Ory login for the Gemini session itself.** *(Optional but recommended.)* Out of the box the extension only governs your *app*. To also attach an Ory identity to *Gemini's* session — so every tool call is attributed to you, not a fallback `session:<id>` subject — opt in to the user-login flow:

   ```bash
   export ORY_USER_LOGIN=true
   export ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<value printed by `local up`>
   ```

   User login is off by default. Both exports above are printed in the `local up` banner — copy them straight from there. `ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` is required whenever `ORY_USER_LOGIN` is on: it identifies the public OAuth2 client the PKCE browser flow exchanges for a token. With both set, the next Gemini session opens an Ory login in your browser; sign in with the same seeded credentials from step 1, and the token is reused on subsequent sessions until it expires. This is what makes `permissions enforce` (see [Agent security](#agent-security)) deny on the right identity later.

That's the full Ory DX path. Stop here if you're just evaluating the extension. Continue to [Agent security](#agent-security) when you're ready to enforce.

## What's included

### Skills for scaffolding Ory into your application

The extension bundles a catalog of skills that Gemini auto-invokes by description. Ask Gemini in natural language or invoke a skill directly:

**Start here — add Ory auth to your app:**

- **`ory-auth-setup`** — full project setup. Install the Ory CLI, create an Ory Network project (or use the local one), add Ory Elements, configure the SDK, build the auth pages, wire session middleware.
- **`ory-login-flow`** — login, registration, recovery, verification, and settings pages with Ory Elements. Next.js App Router and React SPA variants.
- **`ory-social-login`** — Google, GitHub, Apple, Microsoft, Discord, and other OIDC providers with Jsonnet data mappers.
- **`ory-local-dev`** — drive the local Ory stack from within Gemini to prototype and test without a remote project.

**Going further:**

- **`ory-permissions-onboarding`** — bootstrap permissions for built-in tools, switch between observe and enforce mode, troubleshoot denials.
- **`ory-build-integration`** — pull the runnable subset of an `ory/integrates` template (webhook / config / http-event) into your own app and wire it to your Ory project — no contribution/registry concerns.
- **`ory-contribute-integration`** — author a brand-new integration as a contribution to `ory/integrates`, including `registry.entry.yaml`, the `Maintained by:` footer, DCO sign-off, and registry regeneration.
- **`ory-e2b-sandbox`** — scaffold an [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox template that boots with this extension preinstalled and registered, so every sandbox session is gated by Ory auth, permissions, and tracing without any per-sandbox setup.
- **`ory-build-agent`** — drop `@ory/argus` directly into a custom agent you own (Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK, Mastra, Vercel AI SDK, PydanticAI, LangGraph, Mistral AI, or Salesforce Agentforce) so the user is authenticated, every tool call is authorized against Ory Permissions, and the lifecycle emits trace spans.
- **`ory-temporal-worker`** — scaffold a [Temporal](https://temporal.io) TypeScript worker per the [official local-dev guide](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/typescript/set-up-your-local-typescript), with every Activity gated by an Ory permission check, the worker's agent identity resolved via DCR, and the full lifecycle emitting trace spans.

### Ory MCP server

Bundled and registered automatically. Exposes the Ory CLI and the Ory Network REST API as MCP tools so Gemini can manage identities, OAuth2 clients, projects, permissions, and configuration without ever leaving the chat. Useful for seeding test data, verifying a scaffolded integration, or running one-off admin tasks.

### Local Ory stack

```
/ory:local-up      # start a local Ory instance in Docker
/ory:local-down    # tear it all down
/ory:temporal-up   # start a local Temporal dev server (for ory-temporal-worker)
```

`local-up` runs a complete Ory on your laptop: the Ory APIs (Identities, OAuth2, Permissions) at `http://localhost:4000`, a login UI on `:4455` (not :3000, to avoid Next.js port conflicts), and Jaeger (the trace viewer) on `:16686`. A test user identity is seeded and its credentials are printed for you. Use it to:

- **Learn Ory hands-on** without signing up for a hosted project.
- **Prototype** flows (login, social, MFA, recovery, permissions) against a real Ory backend.
- **Test** an auth integration end-to-end before pushing anything to a real environment.
- **Develop** your application against the same identity, OAuth2, and permission surfaces you'll ship with.

## Pointing at a real Ory project

The Quickstart uses the local stack. If you have a hosted [Ory Network](https://console.ory.sh) project (Ory's managed cloud), point the extension at it with a single configure command. **The extension requires `--oauth2-client-id` whenever `--project-url` is provided** — register the client first (see [Register the user OAuth2 client](#register-the-user-oauth2-client) below), then run:

```bash
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini configure \
  --project-url https://<id>.projects.oryapis.com \
  --oauth2-client-id <public OAuth2 client id>
```

- **`--project-url`** points the extension at your project. The **agent identity** (machine credentials for Gemini's outgoing Ory API calls) is created automatically on first run via OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration ([RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)) against the project's `/oauth2/register` endpoint — no manual step required for that one.
- **`--oauth2-client-id`** is required because the **user** PKCE browser flow (triggered by `ORY_USER_LOGIN=true`) cannot self-register — you must register a public OAuth2 client ahead of time and supply its id here. The configure command refuses to save a project URL without it, so you don't end up with a silently-broken setup later. See [Register the user OAuth2 client](#register-the-user-oauth2-client) below for the exact CLI / Console steps.
- **`--api-key ory_pat_...`** is optional — pass it only if you want to override the auto-registered agent identity with a static personal access token (operator override; rarely needed).

If you only want audit logging (no auth or permission checks), substitute `--audit-only` — the OAuth2 client id is not required in that mode:

```bash
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini configure --audit-only
```

The same settings can be supplied via environment variables (`ORY_PROJECT_URL`, `ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`, `ORY_AGENT_API_KEY`) — env vars take precedence over the config file when both are set, which is what most CI / scripted setups want.

Config is saved to `~/.config/ory-agent-plugins/config.json` and shared across every Ory agent plugin or extension on the machine.

Without configuration the extension still loads cleanly and runs in **pass-through mode**: skills and commands work, but nothing is blocked. You can stay in pass-through mode indefinitely if you only want the DX features.

### Register the user OAuth2 client

If you plan to turn on `ORY_USER_LOGIN=true` (recommended — it's what attributes every tool call to *you* rather than a fallback `session:<id>` subject), your hosted Ory project needs a **public** OAuth2 client (no client secret) registered ahead of time. The local stack provisions this for you automatically; against a hosted project you have to register it once yourself.

The client must list **all four** loopback ports as redirect URIs:

- `http://127.0.0.1:47823/callback`
- `http://127.0.0.1:47824/callback`
- `http://127.0.0.1:47825/callback`
- `http://127.0.0.1:47826/callback`

The extension walks the four ports at runtime so the login can survive any one of them being occupied — Ory rejects the callback if the port it lands on isn't on the registered list, so register all four.

Create the client with the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.com/docs/guides/cli/installation):

```bash
ory create oauth2-client --project <project-id> \
  --name "ory-agent-plugin" \
  --grant-type authorization_code,refresh_token \
  --response-type code \
  --scope openid,offline_access \
  --token-endpoint-auth-method none \
  --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:47823/callback \
  --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:47824/callback \
  --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:47825/callback \
  --redirect-uri http://127.0.0.1:47826/callback
```

…or in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh) under *OAuth2* → *Clients* → *Create client* (pick "Public client", set "Authorization Code" + "Refresh Token" grants, scopes `openid offline_access`, paste the four redirect URIs above). Then persist the issued id with the configure command (preferred — survives across sessions):

```bash
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini configure \
  --project-url https://<id>.projects.oryapis.com \
  --oauth2-client-id <client-id from the step above>
```

…or set it in the environment alongside `ORY_USER_LOGIN`:

```bash
export ORY_USER_LOGIN=true
export ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<client-id from the step above>
```

Headless / CI runs that already hold a session token can skip this entirely by setting `ORY_USER_SESSION_TOKEN` instead — no browser flow runs, so no OAuth2 client is needed.

## Agent security

Once the extension is pointed at an Ory project (local or hosted), Gemini's session and every tool call can be governed by Ory.

- **Authentication.** Two identities. The human at the keyboard (the **user**) authenticates interactively via Ory Identities when user login is enabled (`ORY_USER_LOGIN=true`, off by default — browser PKCE flow on first session, persisted token thereafter). The Gemini process (the **agent**) gets its own OAuth2 identity, self-registered via [Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) on first run.
- **Authorization.** Before any tool runs, the extension checks [Ory Permissions](https://www.ory.com/docs/keto) (Zanzibar-style relations) against the user's subject and blocks the call on `deny`. MCP tool calls additionally get a server-level check.
- **Audit.** Every decision (allow, deny, fallback) is recorded as a structured trace span: NDJSON file output and/or OTLP/HTTP export to Jaeger, Honeycomb, Grafana, and similar collectors. The user → agent delegation is written to Ory as a relation so *"agent X acting on behalf of user Y"* stays queryable after tokens expire.

The extension is **fail-open** on its own infrastructure failures (network errors, rate limits, missing config), so enforcement is only as strong as your permission grants — grant explicit `use` on the tools each user should be able to run.

### Enable enforcement

After install the extension runs in **observe mode**: every tool call is checked against Ory Permissions, but a deny is recorded as a `permission.observe_deny` audit span and the tool runs anyway. This lets you see what *would* be blocked before turning on hard blocking.

1. **Turn on user login.** It's off by default. In your shell:

   ```bash
   export ORY_USER_LOGIN=true
   export ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<public OAuth2 client id>
   ```

   The next Gemini session opens a browser for PKCE login. Subsequent sessions reuse the persisted token until it expires.

   `ORY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` is required when `ORY_USER_LOGIN` is on: PKCE needs a public OAuth2 client registered with the four loopback redirect URIs (`http://127.0.0.1:47823..47826/callback`) to exchange the authorization code for a token. The local stack provisions one and prints the export in its `local up` banner; for a hosted Ory project see [Register the user OAuth2 client](#register-the-user-oauth2-client) for the exact CLI / Console steps. Headless / CI runs can skip the browser flow entirely by pre-supplying `ORY_USER_SESSION_TOKEN` instead.

2. **Bootstrap permissions for the built-in tools.** One idempotent command grants the current user `use` on every tool Gemini ships with (read_file, write_file, shell, …):

   ```bash
   npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions bootstrap
   ```

   If a user identity is already cached at install time, the installer runs this for you automatically — re-run after adding tools, switching subjects, or changing the namespace.

3. **Check coverage.** `permissions status` probes every tool in the harness's catalog and prints allowed / denied per tool:

   ```bash
   npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions status
   ```

   Add permissions for any MCP server tools or custom commands by hand, or via the Ory MCP server from inside Gemini (*"grant me use on the shell tool"*).

4. **Promote to enforce.** Once the observe-mode logs look right, switch over:

   ```bash
   npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions enforce
   ```

   Denies now block the tool call; Gemini shows the denial reason and the decision is recorded as a `tool.block` trace span with `blocked: true`. Switch back any time with `permissions observe`.

## CLI reference

```
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini install                             [--link]
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini uninstall
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini configure                           [--project-url <url> --oauth2-client-id <id>] [--api-key <key>] [--audit-only]
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini agent <status|unregister>           Manage the agent's OAuth2 identity
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions <status|bootstrap|observe|enforce>
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini local <up|down|status|seed|logs|env|configure|reset>
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini status
```

Highlights:

- `agent status` — show the current persisted DCR identity for the agent.
- `permissions observe` / `permissions enforce` — switch between "log denies, allow through" (the install default) and "block denies." `permissions bootstrap` writes `use` permissions for the harness's built-in tools so the promotion path doesn't require hand-writing relations.
- `configure --audit-only` — kill switch that disables Ory entirely (no auth, no permission checks; only audit logging of tool invocations). For phased rollouts, prefer `permissions observe` over `--audit-only`.
- `local seed` / `local env` — reseed the test user, or print env vars for pointing other tools at the local stack.

## Troubleshooting

- **`/ory:local-up` fails.** Make sure Docker is running and ports `4455` (login UI), `4000`, `4100`, and `16686` are free.
- **PKCE login loops.** Clear persisted state with `npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini agent unregister` and retry.
- **`npx` fetches an old version.** Force a fresh fetch: `npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli@latest ory-gemini …`.
- **Need more signal.** Set `ORY_AGENT_DEBUG=true` and `ORY_AGENT_LOG_FILE=/tmp/ory.log` to capture structured logs.
