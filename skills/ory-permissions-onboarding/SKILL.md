# Onboard Ory Permissions for Agent Tool Calls

Help the user connect Agent Security and roll out explicit native-tool blocks
without treating missing grants as denials.

**The plugin only reads permissions. It never writes them.** The permission
model, native-tool blocks, MCP grants, and observe/enforce posture are managed
in the **Ory Console** (Agent Security).

Native policy is simple:

- `AgentTool` and `ShellTool` have no `users` relation.
- Their `use` permit is `!blockedSubjects.includes(subject)`.
- No matching block means allowed; a matching block means denied.
- `observe` logs the block and proceeds; `enforce` vetoes the call.
- MCP permissions and `PermissionMode#enforcedSubjects` remain grant-based.

## 1. Connect Agent Security

Copy the connection details shown in the Ory Console under **Agent Security**:

```sh
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini configure --project-url <URL> --agent-security-url <URL>
```

Then inspect the resolved configuration:

```sh
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini status
```

Confirm that Agent Security is connected and the public OAuth2 login client is
resolved. The plugin needs no workspace privilege or project API key.

## 2. Review Native Tool Access

```sh
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions
```

The report shows:

- The live permission mode and its source.
- The user subject being checked.
- Each built-in native tool as `allowed`, `blocked`, or `errored`.
- A compact allowed/blocked summary for decomposed shell command words.

A fresh project normally reports native tools as **allowed**. There is no grant
coverage step and the local seed writes no baseline `AgentTool` or `ShellTool`
grants.

## 3. Add Explicit Blocks in the Console

To block a native tool, write a `blockedSubjects` relation in the Ory Console:

```text
namespace: AgentTool
object:    <tool name>          e.g. WebFetch
relation:  blockedSubjects
subject:   User:<id>
```

To block a command word reached through a shell tool:

```text
namespace: ShellTool
object:    <command word>       e.g. curl
relation:  blockedSubjects
subject:   User:<id>
```

Blocks can also target the project, an agent credential, an agent session, a
sub-agent credential, or a sub-agent spawn. Group/SubjectSet expansion is
supported. A native deny is always an explicit block, never a missing grant.

MCP is intentionally different: continue granting MCP server/tool access with
its existing `users`/`use` and `invoke` relations.

## 4. Observe Before Enforcing

While the project is in `observe`, run normal sessions and inspect:

```sh
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions
npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini watch
```

Matching blocks emit `permission.block_observed` but the tool still runs. Review
those events, then promote the project or selected principals to `enforce` in
the Ory Console. Every gate reads the project-controlled posture.

## 5. Verify Enforcement

Under `enforce`:

- Tools without a matching block run normally.
- Explicitly blocked tools produce a clear "explicitly blocked" message.
- A blocked `ShellTool` word blocks the outer shell command and names the word.
- Infrastructure failures retain the core fail-open behavior.

If a tool is unexpectedly blocked, use `npx -y -p @ory/gemini-cli ory-gemini permissions` to identify the
block and remove or narrow its `blockedSubjects` relation in the Console.

## Reference

| Command | Effect |
